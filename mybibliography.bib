abstract = {The increasing importance of information technology as a means to access and communicate information has prompted firms to enhance their corporate websites to establish relationships with potential and current customers. Likewise, the value of satisfaction has decreased in favor of customer delight. To develop innovative and delighting websites, however, firms require a more detailed understanding of how they can optimize their websites' user impact. In two empirical studies, this research shows that delight has a stronger impact on purchase intentions than website satisfaction does. This means that companies can benefit from positive repercussions after investing up front to enhance their website. This research also identifies individual website quality factors that firms can manipulate to create delightful consumer web experiences. By examining and distinguishing between their effects on delight and surprise, this research sheds light on how consumers perceive website quality factors. Overall, this research shows how firms can attain customer delight in an online environment and clarifies its effects on consumer behavior.},

@article{Oliver1997,
abstract = {Many business practitioners have addressed the importance of delighting the customer as an extension of providing basic satisfaction. Yet the concept of customer delight has not been given a clear behavioral foundation, and the antecedents and consequences of customer delight, when manifest in specific service contexts, have not been empirically explored. This paper attempts to provide a first step toward establishing a behavioral basis for customer delight, empirically testing its hypothesised antecedents and consequences, and exploring the resulting implications. Based on data from two service fields, structural equation results support the proposition that unexpected high levels of satisfaction or performance initiate an arousal ⇒ pleasure (positive affect) ⇒ delight sequence. Mixed support is found for the hypothesis that delight is a combined result of pleasure and arousal. Satisfaction, acting in parallel with delight, was strongly related to pleasure and disconfirmation and had a clear effect on behavioral intention; the effect of delight on intention, however, appears to be moderated by the service context. Managerial implications include the consideration of whether delight is a reasonable and meaningful consumer expression in particular service contexts, the necessity of focusing on surprising levels of satisfaction or performance when attempting to produce delighting consumption experiences, and potentially separate strategies for inducing satisfaction and delight. {\textcopyright} 1997 New York University.},

@article{Johnston2004,
abstract = {Some organisations are becoming more concerned with delighting their customers than simply satisfying them. Yet despite an extensive literature on service quality and satisfaction little has been written about service excellence and how organisations can achieve delighted customers. The purpose of this exploratory but empirically based paper is to provide a definition of service excellence to help marketers and managers, where appropriate, design and deliver it. This paper is based on over 400 statements of excellent and poor service gathered from around 150 respondents. After categorising them, using a grounded theory approach, it is suggested that service excellence is about being “easy to do business with”. This has four key elements: delivering the promise, providing a personal touch, going the extra mile and resolving problems well. Further analysis of the frequencies of mention revealed the overarching importance of dealing well with problems and queries.},

The personal information collected by recommenders raises the risk of unwanted exposure of that information. Also, malicious users can bias or sabotage the recommendations that are provided to other users. This paper raises important research questions in three topics relating to exposure and bias in recommender systems: the value and risks of the preference information shared with a recommender, the effectiveness of shilling attacks designed to bias a recommender, and the issues involved in distributed or peer-to-peer recommenders. The goal of the paper is to bring these questions to the attention of the information and communication security community, to invite their expertise in addressing them.",

abstract = {Purpose – The object of this paper is to help to understand what it is all about in question when talking about personalization.Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework of personalization is presented, based on the literature.Findings – Marketers are looking increasingly at personalization to help them improve the performance of their efforts. However, personalization seems to be hard to apply. Some of these problems are caused by the fact that personalization means something different to each business and to the different actors in the value chain. This lack of agreement regarding the meaning of personalization limits successful communication between the different actors who produce or buy services and products that are connection with personalized marketing. This hinders co‐operation between service providers and marketers who are willing to apply personalization.Originality/value – It is hoped that the framework is useful when discussing and developing the idea of personalization further.},

@article{Jackson2007,
abstract = {Personalisation has been utilised by various companies in the electronic marketplace. Gartner research stated that by 2004, 80 per cent of content-rich IT applications (eg news sites, e-tailers and corporate intranets) will incorporate personalisation. Personalisation is becoming more of an increasing segment of the internet economy. Customer relationship management (CRM) has been an accepted strategy of companies in order to improve their performance. The concept of personalisation and CRM has expanded in scope to emphasise a much broader notion of benefits to a company. The focus of this paper is to determine whether companies can increase the return generated by their electronic commerce strategy by utilising personalisation in executing CRM in the electronic marketplace. A case-study approach was utilised to identify personalisation strategies and its benefits. Lessons learned from the cases examined revealed that companies should approach personalisation from an inter-functional as opposed to a silo implementation to reap maximal benefits. Our research found that competitive pressures and cost savings helped to spurn the use of personalisation. Personalisation requires anticipating relevant intent of customers in order to increase benefits. Other key findings identified that companies, both business to business (b2b) and business to consumers (b2c), employing personalisation improves the benefits of CRM.Journal of Database Marketing {\&} Customer Strategy Management (2007) 15, 2436. published online 3 December 2007 ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

We identify issues that we envision will be of interest to researchers working in the management sciences, taking an interdisciplinary approach that spans the areas of economics, marketing, information technology (IT), and operations research. We present a framework for personalization that allows us to identify key players in the personalization process as well as key stages of personalization. The framework enables us to examine the strategic role of personalization in the interactions between a firm and other key players in the firm's value system. We conceptualize the personalization process as consisting of three stages: (1) learning about consumer preferences, (2) matching offerings to customers, and (3) evaluation of the learning and matching processes. This review focuses on the learning stage, with an emphasis on utility-based approaches to estimate preference functions using data on customer interactions with a firm.},

@article{Kumar2007,
abstract = {Business and operations strategists have long sought to formulate strategies that would serve profitably for a market of one. Two decades after its conception, there is growing evidence that mass customization strategy is transforming into a mass personalization strategy, making the market of one a reality, at least in select industries. The degree of transformation of a company depends on the extent to which its product is soft, i.e., can be produced electronically. Thus, at the lower end of the personalization spectrum are manufacturing companies engaged in producing hard, configurable products, while on the high end of the spectrum are service companies whose product can be totally configured and delivered electronically. The underlying factors that are enabling this transformation, in our view, are: (1) development of information technologies such as peer to peer (P2P), business to consumer (B2C), and Web 2.0, (2) near-universal availability of the Internet, (3) customer willingness and preparedness to be integrated into the process of product co-design and co-creation, (4) modern manufacturing systems, such as flexible manufacturing and, of course, (5) mass customization tools such as modularity and delayed differentiation, which help reduce manufacturing cost and cycle times and (6) deployment of customer-satisfaction-specific software called customer relationship management (CRM) to engender customer retention. Due to the importance and strategic success of affordable personalization, this issue is dedicated to that theme. The articles included in this issue would, I believe, serve as significant decision support mechanisms for companies pursuing a mass customization and personalization strategy. In addition to providing a brief perspective on articles included in this issue, we also summarize the state of the art of mass customization research. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The goal is to create profit for the producer and increased value for the consumer. This goal fits nicely into traditional notions of segmentation.

Nevertheless, existing (offline) theory may be inappropriate to describe online WOM and its influence on evaluation and purchase.The authors report the results of a two-stage study aimed at investigating online WOM: a set of in-depth qualitative interviews followed by a social network analysis of a sin- gle online community. Combined, the results provide strong evidence that individuals behave as if Web sites themselves are primary “actors” in online social networks and that online communities can act as a social proxy for indi- vidual identification. The authors offer a conceptualization of online social networks which takes the Web site into account as an actor, an initial explo- ration of the concept of a consumer–Web site relationship, and a conceptual model of the online interaction and information evaluation process. {\textcopyright}},

In this paper we define customerization, and describe how it is different from the related strategies of mass customization, personalization, and one-to-one marketing. We also describe the opportunities and challenges companies face in deploying a customerization strategy, and the potential benefits that they might realize.},

abstract = {The use of mobile devices by consumers and the accompanying response by retailers is rapidly revolutionizing the retail environment. In the past, retailers have focused primarily on the outcome (to purchase or not to purchase) of the consumer decision process, but now mobile technologies give retailers the opportunity to more actively influence the entire consumer decision-making processes. The increasing use of mobile devices by consumers makes shopping a continuous rather than discrete activity that requires retailers to engage with their customers at critical touch points of the decision process in order to provide a more customer-centric experience. This change in focus from the decision outcome to the decision process signifies an important paradigm shift for the retailing industry. After an extensive review of the literature, we identify four pillars that form the foundation for the mobile shopping revolution and represent the essential ways and means through which retailers can engage with consumers during the decision process. We also discuss the different areas in which the pillars can enable retailers to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage in the mobile shopping era.},
